What's cooking competition in kaggle asks you to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients.
This one was really interesting type of problem and more importantly dataset was small so that I was able to train it in my laptop easily. I tried it over a weekend and was able to get decent accuracy within few attempts.
I have used word2Vec to get word(ingredients) embeddings and then created a sentence embedding using cluster centroids.

cv.py contains code to test algo with different parameters
xgb + centroid features gives score 0.77
